Operator status: offline.

Public code is intentional.
Private systems exist.
If the system works, it survives.

### 🏗️ Systems Progress

[🔗 Rilis](https://github.com/GSF-001/GSF-001/releases)  

Building autonomous systems that outlive their operators.
No custody. No central control. Only signals and rules.

Active system (architecture & docs):https://github.com/GSF-001/GSF-SYSTEM-/tree/537bd73876f1d0692854cf6230ea3c9491c689e8/docs

Active discussion → https://github.com/GSF-001/GSF-SYSTEM-/discussions/4

#### Roadmap

Q1 → Engine stabilization

Q2 → Non-custodial validation module

Q3 → Distributed node testing

Q4 → Controlled public beta

###  Philosophy

- Systems outlive operators.  
- Incentives are code, not promises.  
- Transparency & autonomy > centralization.  
- Build once → deploy everywhere.  

*“If the system works, it survives. If it fails, it fails visibly.”*

Client → API Layer → Signal Engine → Rule Validator → Journal Layer → Output Interface
