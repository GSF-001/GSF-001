*Again Building autonomous systems that outlive their operators.*  
No custody. No central control. No excuses. Just **signals, rules, and coordination logic**.

###  Philosophy

- Systems outlive operators.  
- Incentives are code, not promises.  
- Transparency & autonomy > centralization.  
- Build once → deploy everywhere.  

*“If the system works, it survives. If it fails, it fails visibly.”*

### Support & Donations

If you like what I build and want to fuel the system… or just fuel my caffeine. ☕ No obligations. Only respect for code & curiosity.
