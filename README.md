Operator status: offline.

Public code is intentional.
Private systems exist.
If the system works, it survives.

###  Philosophy

- Systems outlive operators.  
- Incentives are code, not promises.  
- Transparency & autonomy > centralization.  
- Build once → deploy everywhere.  

*“If the system works, it survives. If it fails, it fails visibly.”*
